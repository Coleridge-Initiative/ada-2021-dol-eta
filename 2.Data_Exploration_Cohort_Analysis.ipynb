    "\n",
    "In the [cross-sectional analysis notebook](./1.Data_Exploration_Cross-section_Analysis.ipynb), we have calculated Illinois weekly certified claimant counts during the COVID recession and average weekly total pay. The first measure allows us to see the **stock of certified claimants** during a specific week and how it changes over time. While it helps us understand how many workers continue to experience unemployment and rely on UI benefits for financial support, **it does not allow us to see the inflow of new certified claimants and to track them over time**. For example, among all the certified claimants who received benefits during the week ending March 28th, how many of them are new entrants? How fast do they leave the UI programs? Do claimants from different demographic groups, industries, and locations exit the program at different rates? If and when have they been exposed to interventions, such as economic shocks and training programs? Do these interventions accelerate or slow down UI program exit rates?"

(*Similar to `week_end_date`, `byr_start_week` is also always a Saturday.*) Recall that in the [cross-sectional analysis notebook](./1.Data_Exploration_Cross-section_Analysis.ipynb), we use `week_end_date` to select our sample. The variable `week_end_date` shows the week a certified claimant **received** his/her benefits. The use of different date variables determines the key difference between the cross-sectional sample and the cohort sample. Specifically, the cross-sectional sample includes every certified claimant who received benefits during the time period we are looking at, regardless when they entered the UI programs. The cohort sample only includes certified claimants who entered the program during the time period we are interested in. **In other words, the cross-sectional sample shows us the stock of certified claimants during a time period, while the cohort sample represents the inflow of new certified claimants during a time period.** "

We combine them as one cohort and call them **the COVID-19 cohort**. We choose this cohort for two reasons. First, they are mostly workers who lost jobs immediately after the massive lockdown in Illinois. Recall that Illinois lockdown order started in mid-March. Claimants usually need two weeks to file and certify their claims. Second, those two weeks account for a disproportionately large number of the claimants who started new benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. This sample gives us enough observations to conduct subgroup analysis at various levels (e.g.: by region and by industry)."

New claims are claims from individuals who are not currently active in the unemployment insurance system. These claims involve a benefit determination based on previous quarters earnings and begin a new benefit year for the claimant. If a claimant files for unemployment insurance but already has an active benefit year that was opened in response to a previous job loss within one calendar year, that is considered an additional claim and the claimant resumes the existing benefit year. By limiting to only new claims and excluding the additional ones, we focus only on the spell of unemployment that began the benefit year in this section."
