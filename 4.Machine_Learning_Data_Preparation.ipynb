    "\n",
    "In the [cohort analysis notebook](./2.Data_Exploration_Cohort_Analysis.ipynb), we have tracked records of the COVID-19 cohort (claimants who entered during the week ending March 28th and the week ending April 4th, 2020) and have calculated their exit rates. We have also examined how claimants from different industries exit at various rates. For example, we found that claimants from REDACTED and REDACTED have slower exit rates than claimants from other industries. However, industry is just one of the factors that are related to claimants' exit rates. What about other factors, such as demographics, occupation, prior earnings, location, and total amount of benefits received from the UI program? Can we use these factors to predict which group of workers are the mostly likely to stay in the UI program and eventually exhaust their benefits? Can interventions, such as economic shocks and/or training programs, accelerate claimants' rate of returning to work? "

    "In the two machine learning (ML) notebooks, we will develop a machine learning model to answer these questions. We will use it to predict claimants who are the most likely to stay in the UI program for 13 weeks or longer and to examine how economic shocks influence claimants' exit rates. In the first ML notebook, we will formulate the research questions and clean up the data, including identifying and constructing rows, and creating labels (outcome, Y) and features (predictors, X). In the second ML notebook, we will split the data into a training set and a testing set. We will train a few models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest. Finally, we will evaluate these models by using several measures, such as accuracy, precision at K, and recall at K. \n",
