    "In the [cross-sectional analysis notebook](./1.Data_Exploration_Cross-section_Analysis.ipynb) and the [cohort analysis notebook](./2.Data_Exploration_Cohort_Analysis.ipynb), we have analyzed IL certified claimants data and have created summary statistics, such as weekly claimant counts, average weekly total pay, exit rate of the COVID-19 cohort claimants during each week after program entry, etc. Sometimes, it is hard to see trends and to communicate with your audience by only looking at summary statistics. In this notebook, we will import the csv files we saved in the previous two notebooks and learn how to turn them into informative visualizations. We will also discuss what type of visualization to choose for different types of analyses and how to use labels and plot adjustments to better present your results. As you work through the notebook, we will have checkpoints for you to practice using the code. You can think about how you might apply any of the techniques and code presented in this notebook to your project."

It is hard for the audience to see key time points, such as during which week the number of certified claimants started to increase and when it peaked. Therefore, we want to adjust the x-axis tick so that it shows weeks instead of months and shows the time points more frequently. In this case, we use `scale_y_continuous()` for the y-axis to specify a continuous data type and to adjust tick marks and axis extent, and `scale_x_date()` for the x-axis to specify a date data type, adjust the x-axis start and end points, specify the display format, and set the tick mark interval. In both cases, `breaks=` statement controls the minimum and maximum values of the axis labels as well as the tick mark intervals between them. For `scale_x_date()`, the `labels=` statement specifies how the date will display. In this case, `%b %d` means a three-letter abbreviation of the month name followed by the date."

    "5. **Key Time Points**: In this analysis, labelling key timepoints, such as when the lockdown in IL started or the week with the peak number of claimants, helps the audience understand the context. However, it is not necessary to add key timepoints to every graph. We can add vertical lines to the graph to represent significant events using the `geom_vline()` statement and control labels for these lines using the `annotate()` statement. Within `geom_vline()` we must specify where to place the line using the `xintercept=` command. In our case, we assign the date of the Illinois stay at home order (3-21-2020) to a variable and then pass this variable to `xintercept=`. When we use the `annotate()` statement, we must specify the location of the labels using the `x=` and `y=` statements. Keep in mind you will likely need to adjust these based on specific details of your graph. In the example below, we use a height of REDACTED, which places the label nearly at the top since the max extent of our y-axis is (REDACTED)."

Looking at the end of the cohort, however, only roughly (REDACTED) of claimants who persist to (REDACTED) have exited by (REDACTED). After (REDACTED), there is a REDACTED. We expect this because regular UI benefits are only authorized for 26 weeks in Illinois, though claimants may draw them down at a slower rate by earning part time wages, which is why some still remain after this point. Note the biweekly pattern we observe with the biggest changes in counts every other week. This is related to Illinois biweekly certification schedule: claimants tend to certify for both weeks, or neither."
